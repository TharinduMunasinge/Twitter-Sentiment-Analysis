 it's really aggressive to blast obnoxious "entertainment" in your guests' faces &amp; they have little recourse
 and it's a really big bad thing about it
" seriously would pay $30 a flight for seats that didn't have this playing.
it's really the only bad thing about flying VA"
 SFO-PDX schedule is still MIA.
  I flew from NYC to SFO last week and couldn't fully sit in my seat due to two large gentleman on either side of me. HELP!

 Hi, Virgin! I'm on hold for 40-50 minutes -- are there any earlier flights from LA to NYC tonight; earlier than 11:50pm?
 everything was fine until you lost my bag
 your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? /hy0VrfhjHt
 what is going on with customer service? Is there anyway to speak to a human asap? Thank you.
 why can't you supp the biz traveler like   and have customer service like  #neverflyvirginforbusiness
 you're the best!! Whenever I (begrudgingly) use any other airline I'm delayed and Late Flight :(
 I have no interesting flying with you after this. I will Cancelled Flight my next four flights I planned.#neverflyvirginforbusiness
 it was a disappointing experience which will be shared with every business traveler I meet. #neverflyvirgin
 I‚Äôm having trouble adding this flight my wife booked to my Elevate account. Help? /pX8hQOKS3R
 Why is the site down?  When will it be back up?
 I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday .
 just landed in LAX, an hour after I should of been here. Your no Late Flight bag check is not business travel friendly #nomorevirgin
 Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn't a great user experience.  Time for another redesign.
 I can't check in or add a bag. Your website isn't working. I've tried both desktop and mobile /AvyqdMpi1Y
 - Let 2 scanned in passengers leave the plane than told someone to remove their bag from 1st class bin? #uncomfortable
 What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
 is anyone doing anything there today?  Website is useless and no one is answering the phone.
 why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax
 how's a direct flight FLL-&gt;SFO have unexpected layover in Vegas 4 fuel yet peeps next to me bought for Vegas flight. #sneaky
 your no Late Flight bag check just lost you my business. I missed flight and AM apt. Three other people on flight had same exp.
 called your service line and was hung up on. This is awesome. #sarcasm
 your site is tripping. I'm trying to check in and I'm getting the plain text version. I am reluctant to enter any card info.
 should I be concerned that I am about to fly on a plane that needs to be delayed due to a "tech stop"?
 Use another browser! 2015 &amp; a brand with a reputation built on tech response doesn't have a cross-browser compatible website?
 And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks, what is the problem?
 I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
 i need to change my flight thats scheduled in 9 hours and 120 min wait time on phone. Im calling intern. Help!!
 you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check.
  us too! Terrible airline! Just gave us a hotel hotline number and said sorry
  your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you!
 Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless
